## Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler

Welcome to the simple calendar application! This app is designed to help you store activities or tasks that you need to complete throughout the day. The app provides timeblocks for each hour of the regular American workday, starting at 8am and ending at 5pm.

The timeblocks are color-coded based on the current hour. The past timeblocks are displayed in gray, the present timeblock is displayed in red, and the future timeblocks are displayed in green. This makes it easy for you to quickly see which tasks you have completed and which ones are yet to be done.

You can input your tasks in the text box provided and save them. The app stores your tasks to local storage and retrieves them to display on the page when you load the page again.

Thank you for using our simple calendar application. We hope it helps you stay organized and on top of your tasks throughout the day!
